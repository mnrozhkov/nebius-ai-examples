    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Many powerful open-source LLMs have emerged and are easily accessible. However, they are not designed to be deployed to your production environment out-of-the-box; instead, you have to **fine-tune** them for your specific tasks, such as a chatbot, content generation, etc. One challenge, though, is that training LLMs is usually very expensive. Even if your dataset for fine-tuning is small, the backpropagation step needs to compute gradients for billions of parameters. For example, fully fine-tuning a 7B model requires 112GB of VRAM, i.e. at least two 80GB H100 GPUs. Fortunately, there are many research efforts on how to reduce the cost of LLM fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to build a Python coding aassitant by fine-tuning the Qwen2.5 7B model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "1. Hands-on learning of the typical LLM fine-tuning process.\n",
    "2. Understand how to use **LoRA** and **PEFT** to overcome the GPU memory limitation for fine-tuning.\n",
    "3. Manage the model training cycle using **MLflow** to log the model artifacts, hyperparameters, metrics, and prompts.\n",
    "4. How to save prompt template and inference parameters (e.g. max_token_length) in MLflow to simplify prediction interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Actors\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn about the techniques and methods behind efficient LLM fine-tuning by actually running the code. There are more detailed explanations for each cell below, but let's start with a brief preview of a few main important libraries/methods used in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B) model is a pretrained text-generation model with 7 billion parameters, developed by [Qwen](https://github.com/QwenLM). Qwen2.5 is the latest series of Qwen large language models.\n",
    "* [LoRA](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/training/lora) is a novel method that allows us to fine-tune large foundational models with limited GPU resources. It reduces the number of trainable parameters by learning pairs of rank-decomposition matrices.\n",
    "* [PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/en/index) is a library developed by HuggingFace🤗, that enables developers to easily integrate various optimization methods with pretrained models available on the HuggingFace Hub. With PEFT, you can apply LoRA to the pretrained model with a few lines of configurations and run fine-tuning just like the normal Transformers model training.\n",
    "* [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) manages an exploding number of configurations, assets, and metrics during the LLM training on your behalf. MLflow is natively integrated with Transformers and PEFT, and plays a crucial role in organizing the fine-tuning cycle."

    "* [peft](https://pypi.org/project/peft/) - for creating a LoRA adapter on top of the Transformer model.\n",
    "* [trl](https://pypi.org/project/trl/) -  for post-training foundation models using advanced techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\n",
    "* [accelerate](https://pypi.org/project/accelerate/) - a dependency required by bitsandbytes.\n",

    "\n",
    "[LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation)](https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA) is a preceding method for resource-efficient fine-tuning, by reducing the number of trainable parameters through matrix decomposition. Let `W'` represent the final weight matrix from fine-tuning. In LoRA, `W'` is approximated by the sum of the original weight and its update, i.e., `W + ΔW`, then decomposing the delta part into two low-dimensional matrices, i.e., `ΔW ≈ AB`. Suppose `W` is `m`x`m`, and we select a smaller `r` for the rank of `A` and `B`, where `A` is `m`x`r` and `B` is `r`x`m`. Now, the original trainable parameters, which are quadratic in size of `W` (i.e., `m^2`), after decomposition, become `2mr`. Empirically, we can choose a much smaller number for `r`, e.g., 32, 64, compared to the full weight matrix size, therefore this significantly reduces the number of parameters to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the mathematics behind LoRA is intricate, [PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/en/index) helps us by simplifying the process of adapting LoRA to the pretrained Transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, we create a [LoraConfig](https://github.com/huggingface/peft/blob/main/src/peft/tuners/lora/config.py) with various settings for LoRA. These hyperparameters might need optimization to achieve the best model performance for your specific task. **MLflow** facilitates this process by tracking these hyperparameters, the associated model, and its outcomes."

    "Finally, we will call [mlflow.transformers.log_model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.transformers.html#mlflow.transformers.log_model) API to log the model to MLflow. A few critical points to remember when logging a PEFT model to MLflow are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MLflow logs the Transformer model as a [Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines).** A pipeline bundles a model with its tokenizer (or other components, depending on the task type) and simplifies the prediction steps into an easy-to-use interface, making it an excellent tool for ensuring reproducibility. In the code below, we pass the model and tokenizer as a dictionary, then MLflow automatically deduces the correct pipeline type and saves it.\n",
    "2. **MLflow does not save the base model weight for the PEFT model**. When executing `mlflow.transformers.log_model`, MLflow only saves the small number of trained parameters, i.e., the PEFT adapter. For the base model, MLflow instead records a reference to the HuggingFace hub (repository name and commit hash), and downloads the base model weights on the fly when loading the PEFT model. This approach significantly reduces storage usage and logging latency; for instance, the logged artifacts size in this tutorial is about 1GB, while the full `Qwen2.5-7B` model is about 20GB.\n",
    "3. **Save a tokenizer without padding**. During fine-tuning, we applied padding to the dataset to standardize the sequence length in a batch. However, padding is no longer necessary at inference, so we save a different tokenizer without padding. This ensures the loaded model can be used for inference immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Currently, manual logging is required for the PEFT adapter and config, while other information, such as dataset, metrics, Trainer parameters, etc., are automatically logged. However, this process may be automated in future versions of MLflow and Transformers."

Please note that not all the Transformer pipelines are supported for pyfunc loading, refer to the [MLflow documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/transformers/guide/index.html#supported-transformers-pipeline-types-for-pyfunc) for the full list of supported pipeline types.\n",

As you can see in the code and result above, the system prompt and default inference parameters are applied automatically, so we don't have to pass it to the loaded model. This is super powerful when you want to deploy multiple models (or update an existing model) with different the system prompt or parameters, because you don't have to edit client's implementation as they are abstracted behind the MLflow model :)"
