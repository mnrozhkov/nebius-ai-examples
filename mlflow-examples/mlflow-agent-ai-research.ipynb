    "# Tutorial: Simplifying Agent Development with MLflow & CrewAI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** This tutorial demonstrates how Managed MLflow transforms the development of multi-agent systems (using CrewAI as an example) from a potentially opaque and difficult-to-debug process into a structured, observable, and iterative engineering workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** We will use the \"AI Research\" agentic systen. This system researches new AI/ML tools. While useful, developing such agents presents common challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Black Box Execution:** What *exactly* did the agent do step-by-step? Why did it choose *that* tool?\n",
    "*   **Comparing Changes:** How do we reliably compare results if we tweak prompts or agent configurations?\n",
    "*   **Debugging Failures:** Why did the agent fail? What was it trying to do right before the error?\n",
    "*   **Performance:** Is the agent getting slower? Where are the bottlenecks?\n",
    "*   **Quality Evaluation:** Is changing the LLM or prompts actually improving the *quality* of the output?\n",
    "*   **Cost/Speed Optimization:** How can we track and reduce token usage or latency?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will tackle some problems by incrementally integrating MLflow tracking features into our CrewAI development process."

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Launch your instance of the Managed Service for MLflow with [the MLflow quickstart](https://docs.nebius.com/mlflow/quickstart).\n",
    "2. Set up your API key to connect to Nebius AI Studio with [the AI Studio quickstart](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/inference/quickstart).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Launching an MLflow cluster for the first time may take 15-30 minutes to be fully provisioned and ready to use."

      "images. Intelligent document comparison with ProcurementGPT ProcurementGPT streamlines document analysis by automatically parsing documents into sections or clauses, then identifying the most similar counterparts across documents—working symmetrically in both directions. It further breaks down clauses into key requirements, determining where each one is fulfilled and highlighting met and unmet requirements for easy review. The system leverages the top 10 most similar requirements to assess compliance, with an overlay for quick navigation. Users can also manually select sections for comparison, ensuring flexibility when automated parsing needs refinement.

LangChain stands out for its modular design and direct focus on LLM integration, while TensorFlow offers robust deep-learning capabilities. **PyTorch** follows closely with a score of **8/10**, providing flexibility for RAG applications. **Keras** and **H2O.ai** come in at **7/10** and **6/10** respectively, with limited effectiveness for more complex systems and specific use cases in conversational AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, for building a sophisticated conversational RAG system, investing resources in **LangChain** or **TensorFlow** is highly recommended, while **PyTorch** can serve as a viable alternative for flexible model experimentation.\n"

      "## Introduction\n",
      "This report evaluates several AI tools with potential applications in a **Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, focusing on the ability to answer questions based on a large collection of PDF documents. The existing stack includes **LangChain**, **PostgreSQL**, and **FastAPI**, which work together to create a robust environment for conversational AI.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 1. LangChain\n",
      "**[LangChain](https://langchain.com/)**\n",
      "- **Description**: A modular framework designed for creating applications powered by language models (LLMs) with seamless integration of various data sources.\n",
      "- **Compatibility**:\n",
      "  - With LangChain: Yes\n",
      "  - With PostgreSQL: No\n",
      "  - With FastAPI: Yes\n",
      "- **Features**:\n",
      "  - Modular architecture for flexibility.\n",
      "  - Tools for integrating LLMs and document retrieval processes.\n",
      "- **Pros**:\n",
      "  - Strong community support.\n",
      "  - Highly customizable for different contexts and use cases.\n",
      "- **Cons**:\n",
      "  - Initial setup time required, which may be a barrier for quick starts.\n",
      "- **Recommendation Score**: **9/10**  \n",
      "  **Justification**: LangChain's modular approach and flexibility make it ideal for custom applications that require integration with large datasets and language models.\n",

While **Keras** and **H2O.ai** may be more suitable for simpler tasks or specific business applications, leveraging the strengths of these tools will enable developers to create sophisticated conversational systems capable of addressing complex inquiries based on document collections.\u001b[00m\n",

    "*   **Comparison:** Systematically evaluate the impact of changes (prompts, LLMs, agent logic) using the MLflow UI's compare feature for parameters, metrics, and artifacts.\n",
    "*   **Debugging:** Quickly identify and analyze failed runs using status tags and dedicated error logs.\n",
    "*   **Performance Monitoring:** Track execution time and other metrics to identify bottlenecks and regressions.\n",
